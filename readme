# Project Summary

In this work, multiplicative stochasticity is applied to the learning rate of stochastic optimization algorithms, giving
rise to stochastic learning-rate schemes. In-expectation theoretical convergence results of Stochastic Gradient Descent equipped with
this novel learning rate scheme under the stochastic setting, as well as convergence results under the online optimization
settings are provided. Empirical results consider the case of an adaptively uniformly distributed multiplicative stochasticity and
include not only Stochastic Gradient Descent, but also other popular algorithms equipped with a stochastic learning rate.
They demonstrate noticeable optimization performance gains with respect to their deterministic-learning-rate versions.
